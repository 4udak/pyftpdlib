# Donate #

A lot of time and effort went into making pyftpdlib as it is right now.
If you feel pyftpdlib is useful to you or your business and want to support it's future development please consider donating me (Giampaolo Rodolà) some money.

I only ask for a small donation, but of course I appreciate any amount.

Thanks in advance
