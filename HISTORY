Version: 0.5.1 - Date: XXXX-XX-XX
---------------------------------

Enhancements:

 * Issue #82: added table of contents in documentation.

 * Issue #92: ASCII transfers are now 200% faster on those systems using
   "\r\n" as line separator (typically Windows).

 * Issue #93: A bigger buffer size for send() and recv() has been set resulting
   in a considerable speed improvement for both incoming and outgoing data
   transfers.

Bugfixes:

 * Issue #78: the idle timeout of passive data connections gets stopped in case
   of rejected "site-to-site" connections.

 * Issue #80: demo/md5_ftpd.py should use hashlib module instead of the
   deprecated md5 module.

   retrieving the first bytes of a corrupted file.

 * Issue #85: MKD response is supposed to include the directory name.

 * Issue #87: SIZE should be rejected when the current TYPE is ASCII.

 * Issue #88: REST should be rejected when the current TYPE is ASCII.

   "TYPE L7" should have been used instead.

 * Issue #90: an unhandled exception can occur when using MDTM against a file
   modified before year 1900.

 * Issue #91: an unhandled exception can occur in case accept() returns None
   instead of a socket (it happens sometimes).

   for one sub-directory in FTP root).
